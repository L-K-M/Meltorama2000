# AGENTS.md — operating manual

The operational source of truth for agents (and humans) working on Goo.
When you learn something durable about how this repo behaves — a quirk, a
footgun, a changed convention — **update this document** in the same PR.

## What this app is

A KPT-Goo-style real-time photo-warping app. Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) first;
it is the constitution (product framing, engine architecture, roadmap).
Deviations from PLAN.md get recorded here as they happen.

## Build, test, lint

```sh
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest    # the whole test suite (JVM-only, by design)
./gradlew lintDebug            # hard CI gate — keep it clean
./gradlew assembleDebug        # debug APK
scripts/build.sh               # release APK staged into dist/
scripts/install.sh             # build + install + launch on a device
```

- JDK 17. Android SDK path via `local.properties` (`sdk.dir=…`) or
  `ANDROID_HOME`. Agent sessions: `.claude/setup-android.sh` bootstraps the
  SDK idempotently (wired as a SessionStart hook).
- Versions are pinned ONLY in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Never add an
  ad-hoc version to a build file; never restate catalog versions in docs.

## Toolchain quirks — don't "fix" these

- `compileSdkVersion("android-37.0")` (string form) is deliberately paired
  with `android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=37` in `gradle.properties`.
  The two move together or not at all.
- There is NO `kotlin-android` plugin: AGP 9 provides built-in Kotlin
  support. Only android-application, kotlin-compose, kotlin-serialization,
  ksp, and hilt are applied.
- `app/debug.keystore` is checked in ON PURPOSE and signs BOTH build types
  (`.gitignore` whitelists it). Zero-secret CI, reproducible builds,
  sideload-only distribution — see `docs/decisions/0002`. Do not "rotate"
  it, do not add signing secrets without a recorded product decision.

## Architecture in one paragraph

Single module `:app`, packages first. MVVM with one immutable UiState per
screen (StateFlow from a ViewModel), Hilt DI, single activity, Compose +
Material 3 with a custom always-dark "goo table" theme. The warp engine is
a GLES 3.0 backward-mapped displacement field; brushes stamp kernels into
the field, the **stroke log is the document** (GPU state is a rebuildable
cache), exports replay the log at full resolution. Engine decision logic
lives in `engine/core` as pure JVM classes.

## Conventions and footguns

- Tool/feature proposals live in `docs/proposals/` as numbered
  pre-decision docs (same Status/Date header as ADRs); an accepted
  proposal graduates into PLAN.md's roadmap table, a declined one stays
  with its status flipped to `declined` so the reasoning isn't lost.
  A proposal argues for a tool and prices it — it is not a commitment,
  and it ships no engine code.
- **Tests are JVM-only** (`testDebugUnitTest`); keep decision logic out of
  composables and the GL renderer so it stays testable. No androidTest
  directory exists; adding one means adding the emulator CI job too.
- **"Works in debug, breaks in release"** is almost always a missing R8
  keep rule for a new reflection/serialization entry point — check
  `app/proguard-rules.pro` first.
- The shader math and `engine/core` reference implementations must stay
  trivially close; when one changes, change both, and let the unit tests
  pin the semantics.
- Brush geometry is computed in normalized source coordinates, never screen
  pixels — preview/export parity depends on it (PLAN.md §5.4).
- The editor's bottom controls are a **floating dock, not a rail**
  (`ui/editor/ToolDock.kt`): mode tabs (Brush/Levers/Lenses/GOOvies) own
  the bottom slot, the brush tab is a family-grouped palette grid plus a
  contextual strip (only what the active tool can use), and the whole
  tray collapses into a `ToolPuck` on stroke start. This refines PLAN.md
  §6.2's "candy-button arc" — the puck is the arc's seed, the dock its
  expanded form. Families derive from stamp *behavior* (drag the path /
  hold to pump / leave a mark), so a new `BrushTool` lands in its row
  with no UI edit; panel/tab/family logic is pure JVM in
  `ui/editor/DockState.kt` — keep it that way (tested by `DockStateTest`,
  which also caps any row at eight beads so nothing ever scrolls).
- **A GOOvie keyframe is a pin, not a canvas.** It stores
  `(revision, globals)` — the immutable `StrokeRevision` it was punched
  from — so there is no "editing keyframe 2" in place: you goo the photo
  and re-punch (`repunchSelectedKeyframe`). Two deviations from the
  original PLAN.md §4.1 wording, both recorded there:
  - Editing is NOT paused while the strip is open. The one real
    constraint is that stamps only ever reach the *live* field, so any
    edit inside the strip first flips `UiState.goovieLive` and clears the
    tween. Don't reintroduce an edit lock to "protect" the pins.
  - Pins are revisions, NOT prefix counts (and never a history cursor).
    A count indexes into `StrokeLog.strokes`, which shrinks on undo —
    that is precisely how undo used to flatten a whole strip. Revisions
    are shared, immutable, and outlive a truncated redo branch, which is
    why `rebuild` no longer invalidates the renderer's endpoint cache
    (it is keyed by `StrokeRevisionId`, which is never reused, so it
    can't lie). Don't "optimize" it back to a count.
- **GOOvie export speed scales the frame COUNT, not the frame rate**
  (`MovieSpeed`, `MovieSpec.totalFrames`). The encoder clock, the pts
  ladder and the GIF centisecond delay all stay nominal; changing that
  would mean a variable-rate MP4 and delays GIF viewers silently round.
  The strip itself still plays at 1× — speed is an export choice.
- **The GIF encoder is pure JVM on purpose** (`engine/media/GifPalette`,
  `GifEncoder`: an `OutputStream` and ARGB `IntArray`s, no Android
  types), because the LZW code-width rules are the part that can be
  subtly wrong. `GifEncoderTest` decodes the encoder's own output with an
  independent reader — keep it that way, and note that a GIF LZW decoder
  must drop its dictionary on a clear code or a stale entry answers the
  KwKwK case. Both export sinks share one tween walk
  (`GlWarpRenderer.eachTweenFrame`) so MP4 and GIF cannot disagree about
  what a GOOvie is.
- Runtime revision graphs are intentionally non-serializable. Project
  persistence stores a normalized revision table plus revision IDs rather
  than recursively serializing shared parent nodes — `StrokeLog.snapshot`
  / `restore` and `StrokeLogSnapshot`. Two rules there are load-bearing:
  `snapshot(pins)` must be given the keyframe revisions (a pin can hold a
  revision the history truncated, and it would otherwise not be written),
  and `restore` refuses a malformed table outright instead of
  half-restoring — a blank canvas over the right photo is what "lost all
  my goo" looks like.
- **A saved project's folder changes only when the user saves** (or the
  editor autosaves). Opening one copies its bytes into fresh session files
  (`ImageLoader.importFile`) because the editor treats session files as
  scratch it owns: a Fusion swap deletes the file it replaces, and
  `sweepSessions` collects whatever no session claims. Never point
  `sessionFile`/`sessionFileB` straight at `filesDir/projects/…`. Session
  files are also **write-once** — a new photo always means a new UUID
  name — which is what lets `ProjectStore.copyInto` skip re-copying a
  source of identical length and age on every autosave.
- **Everything is saved; there is no exit prompt.** Leaving the editor
  writes the document and goes (`SaveReason.LEAVE`, with a scrim while it
  runs because the first write of a session copies the photo). `ON_STOP`
  writes too — the last callback before a backgrounded process can be
  reclaimed — and a checkpoint loop (`AutosavePolicy`: quiet-after-edit,
  with a ceiling for people who never pause) covers the foreground crash
  the lifecycle can't. Throwing a goo away is a deliberate act in the In
  room, not an answer to a question on the way out.

  The dialog that used to ask, and the deliberate-vs-autosave machinery
  behind it (`projectSaved`, `discardProject`, two body strings), are
  **gone on purpose** — user-reported, PR #45. The guard only ever existed
  because the session lived in memory alone (ANALYSIS SOL-7 called it
  interim); once nothing can be lost, a prompt about losing it is a
  prompt about nothing, and the flag it needed was one more thing to get
  wrong — it did, and told users their fresh goo was "already saved".
- **`hasUnwrittenChanges` is the only saved-state question.** One property,
  read by the write-on-leave, the checkpoint loop and the Save bead. Do
  not reintroduce a second flag that stays true after a write: a
  checkpoint loop reading one would rewrite the same document forever.
  Relatedly, a checkpoint keeps the preview already on disk rather than
  re-rendering it — the replay runs on the GL thread, and a checkpoint
  fires into a pause the user is about to end.
- **Nothing evicts a project but the user.** The shelf had a cap
  (`ProjectShelf`: 20 projects / 256 MiB, oldest out) and it is **gone on
  purpose** — user-reported, PR #46. An app that always saves and then
  quietly deletes the oldest thing it saved is worse than one that never
  saved: the user cannot even predict which loss they are getting. In its
  place the In room prints the numbers a decision needs — how many goos,
  what they cost, what is free — beside per-goo delete and a
  throw-them-all-away. If you add a size limit back, it needs a product
  decision and a prompt, not a quiet sweep.
  The consequence is real and accepted: the shelf grows without bound,
  and every session that holds work leaves something on it. That is what
  the readout is for.
- **Saved projects stay out of backup.** The two backup allowlists name
  `datastore` and sharedprefs only; `files/projects` holds the user's
  photos, and "nothing leaves your device" is a promise the About screen
  makes out loud. Adding a project path there is a product decision.
- **User-visible wording is a string resource, everywhere.** ViewModels
  and the GL renderer have no Context and no locale, so failures travel as
  `@StringRes Int` (`ExportEvent.Failed`, `UiState.error`,
  `GlWarpRenderer.onUnsupported`) and the exception's own English text
  goes to Logcat. The app ships `values/` and `values-b+zh+Hans/`, listed
  in `res/xml/locales_config.xml` (Android 13+ per-app language) — add a
  locale to that file in the same change that adds its `values-*` folder,
  or the picker won't offer it. Lint's `MissingTranslation` is a hard CI
  gate, so brand and symbol strings carry `translatable="false"`.
- The app has **no INTERNET permission**. Keep it that way; adding any
  network dependency is a product decision requiring an ADR.
- App display name lives ONLY in `strings.xml` — `app_name` (short, for
  the launcher) plus `app_name_full`/`app_model` for the Wordmark lockup.
  Never hardcode "Meltorama" in a composable (rename checklist: PLAN.md
  "Renaming"). The applicationId stays `ch.lkmc.goo`; "goo" remains the
  verb and the material ("Goo Your Photos", GOOvies, UnGoo).
- The design language is a retro-future console: gunmetal panels with
  milled bevels (`Modifier.chromePanel`), neon domes in swept chrome rims
  (`ChromeButton`/`ChromeIconButton`), one light source for every bevel
  (above, slightly left). Colors come from `ui/theme/Color.kt` — no ad-hoc
  Color(0x…) in screens.
- Scripts follow the family house style: header comment doubles as
  `--help` via the awk one-liner; `==>` / `--` / `!!` log prefixes;
  `set -euo pipefail`.
- Sample images must be public domain / CC0 with provenance recorded in
  this file when added. Current samples (`app/src/main/assets/samples/`):
  `goo-guy.png` and `candy-blobs.png` are generated procedurally by
  `scripts/generate_samples.py` from the app's own palette — provenance is
  this repo, license is the project's (Unlicense). Regenerate with
  `python3 scripts/generate_samples.py`.

## CI/CD

Three workflows (details: [CICD.md](CICD.md)): `ci.yml` (tests + lint +
debug APK on every PR/main push), `release.yml` (v* tags → verified,
published APK), `zai-code-review.yml` (GLM 5.2 reviews every PR; respond
per [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)). Family contract on every workflow:
least-privilege permissions, explicit concurrency, timeouts, wrapper
validation.

## Releasing

`scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z --push` (shared lkm-release engine) bumps
versionName, auto-increments versionCode by exactly 1, rewrites the README
version marker, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes. **Never hand-edit
versionCode. Never create a `v*` tag by hand.** Bump the most-minor version
component + versionCode on every non-trivial change set.

## Review process

PRs are reviewed by GLM 5.2 automatically. Findings are triaged
apply/decline/refute per [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); declined findings and
their reasons accumulate in [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) so later rounds (and
later agents) don't flip-flop. Point-in-time review snapshots archive under
`docs/reviews/`.
